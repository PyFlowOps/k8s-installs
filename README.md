# PyFlowOps Kubernetes Installations

This repo houses the kubernetes manifests and the plaform engineering design
to make Kubernetes a little easier and less complex to use.

**NOTE**: This is **NOT** meant to replace the need to understand Kubernetes, the `kubectl`, etc.
This is simply meant to lower the bar-to-entry so that developers can develop, test, and deploy
to a Kubernetes cluster locally, and remove the context switching, and the cognitive load that
running a Kubernetes cluster brings.
